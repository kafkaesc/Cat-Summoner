# Cat Summoner üê±

Built by Jared Hettinger

Cat Summoner is a site for summoning cats. Built with React, Next, TypeScript, and Tailwind. Tested with Jest and React Testing Library. Visitors to the site can call a cat by clicking the button with their name. They will be treated to a random photo of the summoned cat. Once a photo is found it will be "unlocked" and viewable in the user's catbook.

A working version of this site can be viewed at https://cat-summoner.com
